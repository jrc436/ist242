Basic Instructions:
You should never, for any reason, use Scanner or make a println statement. Either of these will cause your project to be worth zero points.

You should have at least four packages, game.project, game.project.commands, game.project.maps, and game.project.players. The code may not run
if all of these packages are not present (even if they're empty). 

Basic Tasks:
In game.project, you should implement an abstract class for ICombatant called Combatant. This handles your basic combat logic.
In game.project, you should implement abstract classes for IPlayer, IMap, and IMapTile called Player, Map, and MapTile. This should handle 
your basic movement logic. 
In game.project.maps, you should create at least one map, composed of at least four unique map tiles. This map must support a default (no argument) constructor
In game.project.players, you should create
